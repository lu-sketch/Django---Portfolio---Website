    <h1>Educational Background </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Data Science Bootcamp - 2022 </h3>
    <p> My latest education experience was in 2022.  I decided to do a career 
      from economics and finance into Data Science.  My existing experience in
      Economics and finance, I see as a great foundation for Data Science and 
      later moving into Bussiness analytics.

    <h3>Software enginnering Bootcamp - 2024</h3>
    <p>
      Currently I am enrolled in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Hyperiondev.
      I am working on tasks and projects where I learn to develop websites.
      I am very exited about this! It brings out my creative side.  I love 
      developing websites where you can see it take shape before your eyes
      and that you can literally change anything into the vision that you have
      for the website.
      <br>

        In my first project I used HTML and CSS to devolep a portfolio website.
        Then I moved on to work with the following frameworks;
        <br> Bootstrap and Django.
