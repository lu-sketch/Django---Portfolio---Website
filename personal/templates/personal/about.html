        <h2>My journey</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            My journey started on a livestock and game farm. Outside every day
            with the animals, it was heaven! Spent as much of my time as possible
            outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey continued, after school, studying as an Agricultural Economist.
            I embarked on my Agricultural Economic journey with the Department of
            Agriculture in Bloemfontein. There I did market research.
            We held farmer days to help upcoming farmers with step-by-step
            instructions on how to identify their target markets and
            how to deliver their products to their customers.
            I learned how to do project feasibility studies, project management for upcoming
            farmer's projects. We held market research workshops to educate and
            advise farmers about the marketing chain and how to deliver their products
            to their markets/customers fast and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>After life happened, it took me on a different path, one that led to
            Data Science and Hyperiondev. I learned my first programming language --
            Python. Then I moved on to Machine learning and Deep Learning.
            The biggest surprise for me was....I love this!!
        </p>
